# About

## The Class (Algebra 2)

Welcome to Algebra 2 (also called MTH308 if you want to sound like you're on a top secret government mission). This semester, we'll be learning a lot of things, including **factoring polynomials, solving quadratic functions, radical and rational expressions, complex numbers, systems of equations**, and more!

Some things to do for class:

- Come to CC sessions everyday you're invited. We meet at least 4 days a week most weeks.
- Log into the course (in the OLS) and complete all assignments listed in your Course Plan by the due date.
- Read and respond to any and all emails from your teachers.
- Reach out to us any time you have questions!

Welcome! My name is Mrs. Vetter. I will be your Algebra II teacher for the semester. I live in Southeast Michigan with my husband, five year-old boy, and twin three year-old girls. We have a dog named Samson. When I'm not working, I love to run, go camping, and traveling. I have taught online for 7 years. I also taught in North Carolina for 6 years before that. I graduated from Eastern Michigan and grew up in SE MI. I am very excited to get to know you and have a successful semester!
