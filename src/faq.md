## How do I type math for the quizzes and tests?

Because our quizzes and tests are mostly computer-graded, it's important that you know how to type math correctly, so there are as few issues as possible. Remember, you should **always** review your graded quiz to make sure there are no questions marked wrong because of minor computer grading issues. With that in mind, here are a few tips for typing math:

### General Tips
- No spaces. No spaces. No spaces! (If I say it three times, maybe it will come true)
- Use the correct variable when typing answers (don't use 'x' if the problem used 'y')
- Don't use 'x' for multiplication. For example, when factoring a quadratic trinomial, you would type the answer as (x+3)(x-4), **not** (x+3)x(x-4).
- When typing math, the minus sign and the negative sign will both be the same symbol: -
### Computer Grading
- ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK YOUR GRADED QUIZ!
- If you feel that you were marked wrong but SHOULD have been marked correct, send an email to your teacher.
- When reviewing quizzes and tests, you may notice that the computer will give answers with an extra set of parentheses. This is so it can show if there are multiple answers. For example, the computer may show an answer as ((x-3)(x+4),(x+4)(x-3)). This is just to show two possible variations of the answer. Your final answer should be typed either (x-3)(x+4) or (x+4)(x-3), depending on which order you put it in.
- When the answer can be given in any order, the computer will show multiple possible answers, like so: (answer1, answer2, answer3, etc). For example, if the answer is $ \pm{2i} $, you could write this as **either** 2i,-2i **or** -2i,2i. The computer will represent this as (2i,-2i, -2i,2i). Note the space between the possible answers and the additional parentheses as mentioned before.
### Exponents and roots
- Use the carat symbol (^) to represent exponents (example, $ x^2 $ would be typed as x^2). You can type this on your keyboard by pressing Shift+6.
- When typing square roots, use sqrt for the symbol and put the radicand in parentheses. For example, $ \sqrt{2x+3} $ would be typed as sqrt(2x+3).
### Fractions
- When typing fractions, simply lay them sideways. For example, $ -\frac{2}{3} $ would be typed as -2/3.
- Unless the problem otherwise specifies, do not convert fractions to decimals. Leave them as fractions, even if they are "improper" fractions.
### Exponentials
- When typing expoentials with transformations happening in the exponent, put parentheses around everything in the exponent.
- If your answer is $ 2^{3x-1}+5 $, you would type your answer as 2^(3x-1)+5, to clarify what is in the exponent vs what is not.

## Why did my grade drop?

Every Monday, zeroes are entered into the gradebook for missing assignments. These aren't permanent, so you can always submit the assignment later to bring your grade back up. There are no late penalties in Algebra 2, so you will get your full due credit for the assignment when it's turned in.

## How is my grade calculated?

Algebra 2 uses what's called a **"weighted" gradebook** and the **SBG scale**.

The **weighted gradebook** means that certain graded things are worth more than others. In our gradebook, 5% of the grade is based on participation/good class habits, while the remaining 95% is split between our 10 standards. That means each standard is worth 9.5% of your grade.

The **SBG scale** means that you won't see percentages in your gradebook, like a 65% D or a 87% B. Instead, you'll see either a 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or a 4. This is a scale that helps you to know how you're doing on each standard. We will discuss this more in class.

## What are the rubrics used in this class?

Quizzes and tests are both graded with the following rubric: [Quizzes and Tests](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QaCUXfRbc79vPHXj529y_8ODSwO231aziewdPndzuEM/edit?usp=sharing)

Choice Boards are graded using the following rubric, which can also be found in the OHS: [Choice Boards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zhZw3zqikMRYHgt1fOng_Cey6BzHLL1GJw9BgYcskk/edit?usp=sharing)
