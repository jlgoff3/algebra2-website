# FAQ

## Why did my grade drop?

Every Monday, zeroes are entered into the gradebook for missing assignments. These aren't permanent, so you can always submit the assignment later to bring your grade back up. There are no late penalties in Algebra 2, so you will get your full due credit for the assignment when it's turned in.

## How is my grade calculated?

Algebra 2 uses what's called a **"weighted" gradebook** and the **SBG scale**.

The **weighted gradebook** means that certain graded things are worth more than others. In our gradebook, 5% of the grade is based on participation/good class habits, while the remaining 95% is split between our 10 standards. That means each standard is worth 9.5% of your grade.

The **SBG scale** means that you won't see percentages in your gradebook, like a 65% D or a 87% B. Instead, you'll see either a 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or a 4. This is a scale that helps you to know how you're doing on each standard. We will discuss this more in class.
